I tried sort of building a basic game engine around it as well, there's a ton
of room for improvement though and it'll probably be broken down further at
some point...also commented it up all the way, so maybe it'll be educational
to read through?  I don't know...enjoy :D  I know I probably didn't do things
in the simplest way when it comes to using curses, but meh, feel free to send
me some changes! :D
